 Abstract:
The quality of the bicycle network determines ridership, safety, connectivity, equity, and livability. Very few past research studies investigate network connectivity for individual user types and identify network needs and barriers based on these rider types. This study measures the network connectivity for different rider types using Level of Traffic Stress (LTS) and graph theory concepts. As a symbolic representation of a road network and its connectivity, a graph represents the structural properties of networks and compares one measure over another by taking into account spatial features. In addition, this study defines a bicycle network for different types of riders using LTS metrics based on traffic speed, road geometry, and traffic volume. This study evaluates the city of Portland's OpenStreetMap (OSM) bicycle network as a case study. Three transit stations at the downtown, riverside and residential area were considered to assess the connectivity and barriers with a home at block level for last and first-mile coverage. The analysis shows that 29% of links in Portland need to be improved with more bicycle facilities to provide access to adult riders, while 33% of links improvement is required for children. The networks are well connected for ‘strong and fearless’ and ‘confident and enthused’ users but not well connected for adults and children in many neighborhoods with low alpha and Grid Tree Pattern (GTP) indices. The results indicate that planners and designers need to improve their network connectivity for all types of users to ensure equal active transportation opportunities beyond a particular portion of the network.
