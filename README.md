 Abstract
The quality of the bicycle network determines ridership, safety, connectivity, equity, and livability. Very few past research investigated network connectivity for individual user types and identified the needs and barriers. This study intends to measure the network connectivity for different user types using Level of Traffic Stress (LTS) and graph theory concepts. Graph theory is the branch of mathematics concerned with networks of intersections connected by road links and LTS is a measure based on road geometry and traffic volume. The assessment method considers the city of Portland network for the case study. Three transit stations were considered at the downtown, riverside, and residential area to assess the connectivity and barriers with a home at block level for last and first-mile coverage. The results indicate that 29% of links in Portland need to be improved with more bicycle facilities to provide access to adult riders while 33% of links improvement required for children. The downtown network provides better connectivity compared to the riverside and residential network due to its higher grid pattern network. The higher connected network provides more options for user-level stress paths from home to transit stations. The networks are well connected for ‘strong and fearless’ and ‘confident and enthused’ users but not well connected for adults and children outside of downtown. Therefore, planners and designers need to improve the network connectivity for all types of users to ensure equal active transportation opportunities beyond a particular portion of the network. The developed strategy of this study can be implemented in any other city to identify the links/Networks where connectivity needs to be improved by user types.
